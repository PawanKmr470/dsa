# REF : https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
# NOTES :
#       Stack is used to keep last warmer temperature and it's day count so far
#       if temp increases (> than temps which are on stack) then it's compared with
#       stack's top value and days diff is updated in result array. Keep comparing
#       till stack's top element's temperature value is lower.

# T: O(n), brute force method will do in O(n^2)
# S: O(n)
